# CA House Price Prediction

The goal of this project is to train a model to accurately predict house prices. This project utilizes some core data analyst / machine learning techniques such as **data visualization**, **data exploration**, **data manipulation**, **feature scaling / engineeering**, **linear regression**, and **random forest model**. 

As you can see in the data, there is a strong correlation between Median Income and Median House Prices. I was curious to see if I could write a model for predicting house prices based on income alone. I have used the popular **cost function** and **gradient descent** formulas to pinpoint the most accurate model to predict the house prices.


## Utilities / Info

This project utilizes popular libraries such as **matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, and sklearn**. 

1. longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west
2. latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north
3. housingMedianAge: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building
4. totalRooms: Total number of rooms within a block
5. totalBedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block
6. population: Total number of people residing within a block
7. households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block
8. medianIncome: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)
9. medianHouseValue: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)
10. oceanProximity: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea
